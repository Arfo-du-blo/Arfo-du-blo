Passionate about **mathematics**, data, technology, and creative problem-solving. 

I enjoy exploring data science,automation, and system design, applying what I learn to real-world projects.

In my home lab, I experiment with Linux servers, embedded systems, and 3D printing — always driven by curiosity and the desire to understand how things work. 

I believe in open-source collaboration, continuous learning, and building solutions that make a difference.

**Don’t hesitate to contact me** if you’d like to collaborate, share ideas, or need a hand on a project — I’m always happy to help!
